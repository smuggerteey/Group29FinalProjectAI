# Chronic Disease Prediction System

The Chronic Disease Prediction System is an application that allows users to predict chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It utilizes pre-trained machine learning models for each disease prediction.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-app.git
   

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd your-app

4. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. The application provides a sidebar navigation menu where you can choose between different disease prediction options.

### Diabetes Prediction

To predict diabetes, fill in the required information such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and other relevant factors. Click the "Diabetes Test Result" button to see the prediction. You can also click the "Diabetes Education and Prevention Measures" button to get information on diabetes prevention.

### Heart Disease Prediction

To predict heart disease, provide the required information such as age, sex, chest pain types, and other relevant factors. Click the "Heart Disease Test Result" button to see the prediction. You can also click the "Heart Disease Education and Prevention Measures" button to get information on heart disease prevention.

### Parkinson's Prediction

To predict Parkinson's disease, fill in the required information such as MDVP features and other relevant factors. Click the "Parkinson's Disease Test Result" button to see the prediction. You can also click the "Parkinson's Disease Education" button to get information on Parkinson's disease.

## Models

The application uses pre-trained machine learning models for each disease prediction. These models are stored in the repository as pickle files.

## Hosting

You can also host the Chronic Disease Prediction System on a cloud server. Here are the general steps:

1. Set up a cloud server (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine).

2. Install the necessary dependencies on the server.

3. Clone the repository onto the server.

4. Configure any environment variables required by the application.

5. Run the application using a command similar to the following:
   
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 80

   This will start the application on port 80, which is the default HTTP port.
